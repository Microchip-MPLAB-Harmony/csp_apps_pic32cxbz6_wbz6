# EVSYS trigger

This example application demonstrates how to use the EVSYS Peripheral library to setup autonomous, low-latency and configurable communication between peripherals.

## Description

This example application shows how to use the EVSYS Peripheral library to route the events generated by the switch to generate pulse through CCL peripheral without CPU intervention.
